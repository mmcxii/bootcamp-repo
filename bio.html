                Hello! My name is Nich (short for Nicholas), I have been writing
                code for almost a year now and I enjoy it more and more each
                day. I started this process on a whim last September by taking a
                Programing 109 course at Bellevue College. Never before had a
                class motivated me to work and study so easily, I was hooked. In
                the months leading up to this course I have been learning
                whatever I can on my own, but I am very much looking forward to
                formal training with structure to ensure I don't miss anything
                important.
